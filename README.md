# Stock Performance Analysis

This project involves extracting essential data from stock datasets and displaying it graphically. By visualizing this data, individuals can make informed decisions based on the insights gained from the graphs.

## Functions and Tasks:

### 1. Define a Function to Make a Graph
- Implement a function that takes in data and plots it on a graph.

### 2. Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
- Utilize the `yfinance` library to extract stock data.

### 3. Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data
- Employ web scraping techniques to extract revenue data of Tesla.

### 4. Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
- Repeat the process of extracting stock data using `yfinance`.

### 5. Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data
- Use web scraping to extract revenue data of GameStop.

### 6. Plot Tesla Stock Graph
- Plot the stock data of Tesla on a graph.

### 7. Plot GameStop Stock Graph
- Plot the stock data of GameStop on a graph.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.10
- Libraries: `yfinance`, `BeautifulSoup`, `matplotlib`

## How to Run:
